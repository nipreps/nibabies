    caption: Inhomogeneities of the <em>B<sub>0</sub></em> field introduce (oftentimes severe) spatial distortions
      along the phase-encoding direction of the image. Some scanners produce a <em>B<sub>0</sub></em>
      mapping of the field, using Spiral Echo Imaging (SEI) or postprocessing a "phase-difference"
      acquisition. The plot below shows an anatomical "magnitude" reference and the corresponding
      fieldmap.

    caption: Inhomogeneities of the <em>B<sub>0</sub></em> field introduce (oftentimes severe) spatial distortions
      along the phase-encoding direction of the image. Utilizing two or more images with different
      phase-encoding polarities (PEPolar) or directions, it is possible to estimate the inhomogeneity
      of the field. The plot below shows a reference EPI (echo-planar imaging) volume generated
      using two or more EPI images with varying phase-encoding blips.

    caption: Inhomogeneities of the <em>B<sub>0</sub></em> field introduce (oftentimes severe) spatial distortions
      along the phase-encoding direction of the image. Utilizing an <em>anatomically-correct</em> acquisition
      (for instance, T1w or T2w), it is possible to estimate the inhomogeneity of the field by means of nonlinear
      registration. The plot below shows a reference EPI (echo-planar imaging) volume generated
      using two or more EPI images with the same PE encoding, after alignment to the anatomical scan.

    caption: The estimated fieldmap was aligned to the corresponding EPI reference
      with a rigid-registration process of the magintude part of the fieldmap,
      using <code>antsRegistration</code>.
      Overlaid on top of the co-registration results, the displacements along the
      phase-encoding direction are represented in arbitrary units.
      Please note that the color scale is centered around zero (i.e. full transparency),
      but the extremes might be different (i.e., the maximum of red colors could be
      orders of magnitude above or below the minimum of blue colors.)

    caption: Brain mask calculated on the BOLD signal (red contour), along with the
      regions of interest (ROIs) used in <em>a/tCompCor</em> for extracting
      physiological and movement confounding components.<br />
      The <em>anatomical CompCor</em> ROI (magenta contour) is a mask combining
      CSF and WM (white-matter), where voxels containing a minimal partial volume
      of GM have been removed.<br />
      The <em>temporal CompCor</em> ROI (blue contour) contains the top 2% most
      variable voxels within the brain mask.

    caption: Summary statistics are plotted, which may reveal trends or artifacts
      in the BOLD data. Global signals calculated within the whole-brain (GS), within
      the white-matter (WM) and within cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) show the mean BOLD
      signal in their corresponding masks. DVARS and FD show the standardized DVARS
      and framewise-displacement measures for each time point.<br />
      A carpet plot shows the time series for all voxels within the brain mask,
      or if <code>--cifti-output</code> was enabled, all grayordinates.
      Voxels are grouped into cortical (dark/light blue), and subcortical (orange)
      gray matter, cerebellum (green) and white matter and CSF
      (red), indicated by the color map on the left-hand side.

      Right: magnitude of the correlation between each confound time series and the

      effects and can inform decisions about feature orthogonalization prior to
      confound regression.
