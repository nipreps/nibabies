    caption: The estimated fieldmap was aligned to the corresponding EPI reference
      with a rigid-registration process of the magintude part of the fieldmap,
      using <code>antsRegistration</code>.
      Overlaid on top of the co-registration results, the displacements along the
      phase-encoding direction are represented in arbitrary units.
      Please note that the color scale is centered around zero (i.e. full transparency),
      but the extremes might be different (i.e., the maximum of red colors could be
      orders of magnitude above or below the minimum of blue colors.)

    caption: The dataset contained some fieldmap information, but the argument <code>--force-syn</code>
      was used. The higher-priority SDC method was used. Here, we show the results
      of performing SyN-based SDC on the EPI for comparison.

      space to T1 Space - BBR refinement rejected. Note that Nearest Neighbor interpolation
      is used in the reportlets in order to highlight potential spin-history and other
      artifacts, whereas final images are resampled using Lanczos interpolation.

      to T1w-space - The white matter mask calculated with FSL <code>fast</code> (brain
      tissue segmentation) was used for BBR. Note that Nearest Neighbor interpolation
      is used in the reportlets in order to highlight potential spin-history and other

    caption: Brain mask calculated on the BOLD signal (red contour), along with the
      regions of interest (ROIs) used in <em>a/tCompCor</em> for extracting
      physiological and movement confounding components.<br />
      The <em>anatomical CompCor</em> ROI (magenta contour) is a mask combining
      CSF and WM (white-matter), where voxels containing a minimal partial volume
      of GM have been removed.<br />
      The <em>temporal CompCor</em> ROI (blue contour) contains the top 2% most
      variable voxels within the brain mask.

    caption: The cumulative variance explained by the first k components of the
      <em>t/aCompCor</em> decomposition, plotted for all values of <em>k</em>.
      The number of components that must be included in the model in order to
      explain some fraction of variance in the decomposition mask can be used
      as a feature selection criterion for confound regression.

  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: carpetplot, suffix: bold}
    caption: Summary statistics are plotted, which may reveal trends or artifacts
      in the BOLD data. Global signals calculated within the whole-brain (GS), within
      the white-matter (WM) and within cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) show the mean BOLD
      signal in their corresponding masks. DVARS and FD show the standardized DVARS
      and framewise-displacement measures for each time point.<br />
      A carpet plot shows the time series for all voxels within the brain mask,
      or if <code>--cifti-output</code> was enabled, all grayordinates.
      Voxels are grouped into cortical (dark/light blue), and subcortical (orange)
      gray matter, cerebellum (green) and white matter and CSF
      (red), indicated by the color map on the left-hand side.

      Left: Heatmap summarizing the correlation structure among confound variables.
      (Cosine bases and PCA-derived CompCor components are inherently orthogonal.)
      Right: magnitude of the correlation between each confound time series and the
      mean global signal. Strong correlations might be indicative of partial volume
      effects and can inform decisions about feature orthogonalization prior to
      confound regression.
