## NiBabies Coding Style

### Pre-commit

In addition to the [NiPreps coding style](https://www.nipreps.org/community/CONTRIBUTING/#nipreps-coding-style-guide), *NiBabies* leverages [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/#1-install-pre-commit) to ensure consistent code across contributors.
To enable `pre-commit` checks, first [install](https://pre-commit.com/#1-install-pre-commit) the Python package and then run `pre-commit install` in the root of the *NiBabies* source tree.
