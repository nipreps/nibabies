22.0.1 (April 6, 2022)
----------------------
A bug-fix release in the 22.0.x series.

This release includes a fix for when using `UNCInfant` as an output space,
as well as a few improvements to susceptibility distortion correction (SDC).
These include a new flag (`--topup-max-vols`) for controlling the number of
volumes used by TOPUP, and support for SDC in the case where single phase-encoding
fieldmap is used to correct opposite phase-encoding BOLD/EPI runs.

## Full Changelog
* CI: Migrate to token auth when uploading to pypi (#203)
* ENH: Improve fieldmap support (#205)
* STY: Bump style dependencies, run isort on repo (#206)

22.0.0 (March 28, 2022)
-----------------------
A new `NiBabies` minor series!

This release includes a number of new features, as well as various bug fixes. Some of the biggest changes include:
- [Ability to pass in anatomical derivatives](https://nibabies.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faqs.html#leveraging-precomputed-results).
Users can now leverage a precomputed brain mask and/or discrete anatomical segmentations.
- A new flag `--me-output-echoes` to output individual corrected echo time series.
This is useful when doing additional multi-echo processing.

21.0.1 (October 18, 2021)
-------------------------
A patch release in the 21.0.x series.

This patch release is for all **Docker/Singularity** users: `infant_recon_all` did not have all the available templates, which would cause failures for certain ages.
Upgrading to this release will ensure you have all the necessary templates.

## Full Changelog
* DOCKER: Add missing `infant_recon_all` templates (130dcf3)

21.0.0 (October 15, 2021)
-------------------------
The first major release series of 2021.

This release includes enhancements, such as:
 - Fine-grain subcortical alignment during CIFTI generation
 - Improved functional registration to template space
 - Greatly minimized container environment

Additionally, a plethora of bug-fixes are included, and documentation has been improved.

### Caution!
As with all minor version increments, working directories from previous versions **should not be reused**.
